**Our paper titled WaveTransform: Crafting Adversarial Examples via Input Decomposition has been accepted at the ![AROW Workshop, ECCV 2020](https://eccv20-adv-workshop.github.io/)**. This repository will be updated soon.

Advances in Deep Learning have lead to the creation of learning agents that can perform non-trivial human level tasks (such as visual detection, speech recognition etc.). However, there exist inherent vulnerabilities in these systems. These vulnerabilities can be methodically exploited to manipulate the output of the system by subtly changing the input. These changes are almost imperceptible to the naked eye and are termed as adversarial perturbations. In context of visual systems, perturbed images are by design meant to fool networks that are otherwise deemed to be reliable by predicting incorrect classes with confidence. 

I am currently understanding how subspaces in the feature space where these adversarial examples exist relate to the high dimensional decision boundaries and the internal representations made by the model. We are particularly interested in the applications of this field to **Deepfakes** , which has started to make headlines as a political and social tool to spread misinformation. We are attempting to generate *natural* adversarial examples that modify existing artifacts of the image rather
than add noise that can be potentially defended against or be detected.

 ## Shift in Attention of Perturbed Images
To visualize how the attention of a classifier shifts with an adversarial perturbation. I used an implementation of Grad-CAM with the Carlini & Wagner attack, JSMA and the One Pixel attack to obtain Heat Maps (indicating the important regions the classifier looks for in the image), Guided Backpropagation (highlights all contributing features for classification) and Grad-CAM (highlights class discriminative features) mappings. The intensity of pixels indicates prominence of features compared to others.
